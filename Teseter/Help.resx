    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>The Basics:
==================
In the game of Durak, the order, regardless of the suit, is as follows 6,7,8,9,10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace. A trump card beats any card regardless of its color and value.
The goal of the game is very simple – be the first player not to have any cards left in their hand.
As soon as a player discards their last card, the opponent loses and becomes a Durak.

The Setup:
==================
Each player is dealt a hand of six cards in total. After the dealing is done, a single card is chosen. This card will serve for the purposes of assigning a trump card suit. 
So, if a Jack of Spades end up face up, then all Clubs cards are trumps, and become the strongest assets in the game.

The Game:
==================
The game takes many turns, each turn is played out as an “attack.” Over the course of the entire game, you will see multiple attacks taking place.

Phase 1:
The attacking player must have a card in their hand.
If a player wants to counter a card, they need to produce a stronger card. So, if a player puts a 6 of Hearts, in order to stop the player, a defender 
would need to place a higher-value card or use a trump card instead.
When and if a defender manages to fend off an attack, a new phase of the game begins.

Phase 2:
An attack may only continue – as in the 2nd phase – only in the instances when the attacking player is placing a card of the same value as a card that has already been played. 
So, if you had a 6 and a 9 played in the 1st phase, the 2nd phase must either open with a 6 or a 9.

How a turn ends: 
If a defender cannot prevent an attacker from defeating him in the round, the defender will collect all cards that were just played in the turn and add them to his or her hand.
Should the defender beat the attack, then the cards will go to the discard pile and the “end of turn” will take place.

End of the game:
The game continues with players continuing to play and adding a card each turn they attack. When an attacker completes a turn – they need to draw one card from the pile so that
they have six cards again. If a player is already holding six cards, then they shouldn't draw any additional cards.

Thank you for reading, I hope you win!
